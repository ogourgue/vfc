Vegetation/Flow Convolution

This Python module allows to simulate flow velocities around vegetation patches using a computationally-efficient convolution method (conceptual approach) or spatially refine flow velocities from a coarse-resolution model (practical implementation)

Note: Practical approach (spatial refinement) currently only available for unstructured triangular grid models
